      <h2>Character Art</h2>
        <p><strong>I do character art the most.</strong><br>
        I've been doodling characters in sketchbooks and notes for as long as I can remember.<br>
        I find faces especially satisfying to draw, and hair or fluff the most fun to render.</p>

     <h2>Design</h2>
     <p><strong>Most of the following is commissioned work for streamers</strong><br> including: overlays, backdrops, starting break and end screens, as well as emotes and promo material.<br>
     I enjoy vibrant colors the most, but I beleive that every color can look amazing, they just need the right friends.</p>

     <p><strong>I do detailed illustrations the least often out of any of my specialties.</strong><br>
