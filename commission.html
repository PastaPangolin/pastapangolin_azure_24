      <p><small>For example, an Icon with colored lines and cell shading would go:<br>
      <em>Icon 20, lines +10, colored lines +5, flat colors +20, cell shading +25 = 80.</em><br>
      A commission that is just a size and its base price would be an uncolored sketch. </small></p>

      <p><strong>At a 30$ hourly rate I can design for you!</strong><br>
      I'm most experienced in character and graphic design, but feel free to reach out about anything else and I'll see what I can do.</p>
      <p><small>Before starting on a custom design commission we'll go over the specifics of what you'd like and I will give you a time and price estimate according to the details given.</small></p>
      <p><small>At the end of any day I work on the design I will send an update image & description of what I got done that day, as well as an invoice for that day's work. This way you're only paying for work I've done, and if for any reason you wish to cease the commission then I still will have been paid for services provided.</small></p>
